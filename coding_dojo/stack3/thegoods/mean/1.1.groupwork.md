#1. Nested data structures and iteration


Write a function that, given the following constant:

```
const users = [
  {
    fname: "Kermit",
    lname: "the Frog",
    languages: ["Python", "JavaScript", "C#", "HTML", "CSS", "SQL"],
    interests: {
      music: ["guitar", "flute"],
      dance: ["tap", "salsa"],
      television: ["Black Mirror", "Stranger Things"]
    }
  },
  {
    fname: "Winnie",
    lname: "the Pooh",
    languages: ["Python", "Swift", "Java"],
    interests: {
      food: ["honey", "honeycomb"],
      flowers: ["honeysuckle"],
      mysteries: ["Heffalumps"]
    }
  },
  {
    fname: "Arthur",
    lname: "Dent",
    languages: ["JavaScript", "HTML", "Go"],
    interests: {
      space: ["stars", "planets", "improbability"],
      home: ["tea", "yellow bulldozers"]
    }
  }
]
```

Produces the following output:

```
Kermit the Frog knows Python, JavaScript, C#, HTML, CSS, and SQL.
Kermit is also interested in guitar, flute, tap, salsa, Black Mirror, and Stranger Things.
Winnie the Pooh knows Python, Swift, and Java. 
Winnie is also interested in honey, honeycomb, honeysuckle, and Heffalumps.
Arthur Dent knows JavaScript, HTML, and Go.
Arthur is also interested in stars, planets, improbability, tea, and yellow bulldozers.
```

#2. Basic object manipulation

Given a number of US cents, return the optimal configuration (meaning the largest denominations possible) of coins in an object. Use dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.
```
Example:
coinChange(312)
// returns 
{
    dollars: 3,
    dimes: 1,
    pennies: 2
}

Example:
coinChange(78)
// returns
{
    quarters: 3,
    pennies: 3
}
```
BONUS: Given an object with certain amounts of denominations of US money, alter the object so that the configuration is optimal. Can you do this with the same function?
```
Example:
coinChange({dollars: 2, dimes: 15, pennies: 5})
// returns
{
    dollars: 3,
    quarters: 2,
    nickels: 1
}
```

#3. Map, Filter

Write a function `map(array, transformer)` that will return a new array values transformed by the transformer argument. Do not use the built in map function. Example:

```
let transfromer = function (val){
    return val*val
};
map([1,2,3], transformer)
// outputs
[1,4,9]
```

Write a function `filter(array, filterer)` that will will return an array of items from the passed in array that when passed in to the the filterer function return `true`. example:
```
const filterer = val => val % 2 === 0;
const input = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7];

let results = filter(input,filterer);
console.log(results)
//outputs:
[2,4,6]
```
