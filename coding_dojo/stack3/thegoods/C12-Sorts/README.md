# Stack III Sorts

## Friday Biz...
Okay, so all week we've been laerning sorts. It is now time to test them! To talk about our sorts we've been using big(O) terminology. What we are going to do today is look at how each of them compares to each other. To that end we need to be able to measure the different aspects of each algorithm that we discussed, namely space and time. There is a node api that allows us to do so - find the documentation here[]. I've provided an example of how you might go about comparing how fast your sorts are elsewhere in this repository. 

Your mission today:
0) Implement a sort of your choosing
1) Measure how long it takes a sort to run
2) Compare it to another sort (yours or a classmates)
3) Find an input that each sort handles better than the others.
